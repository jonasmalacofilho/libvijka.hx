# libvijka â€“ tools for transport simulators

_This still is in the very early stages!_

We want to provide a simple to use Haxe library of tools for transport
simulators, focusing mainly on the JS (flexibility) and Java (raw speed)
targets:

 - [ ] port [Vijka]'s main definitions, data structures and algorithms (wip)
 - [ ] add tests and optimize current APIs (wip)
 - [ ] complement with urban traffic and transit algorithms
 - [ ] add visualization APIs
